# Online-Food-Delivery-Poject
Wlcome to my project. I am developing this project thats name is 'Online Food Delivery Website' using HTML & CSS language.  
Online food delivery is a service that provides a digital platform for customers to purchase food online via a website or application. These platforms make the process of food ordering convenient and easy by registering and upholding accounts of their customers.
                        An online food ordering system or an online ordering platform is a place where customers can directly order from the restaurant instead of going through a third-party food delivery business. It is a web-based ordering system where customers using a mobile app can use the online user interface to order online.
every online food ordering system built by us is very simple to use regularly. The way online food delivery works is a customer can go to a special website created for the restaurant that is integrated with a payment gateway provider and delivery aggregator.
